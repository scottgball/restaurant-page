# restaurant-page

This project involved a lot of technical "firsts" for me. I used webpack, npm scripts, and ES6 modules all for the first time. I configued webpack and my package.json file, created a gitignore, and wrote the logic for each of the three page tabs in individual javascript modules as opposed to indivudual html pages. This means that almost all of the content is generated through DOM manipulation, and thus this was great practice for creating and appending elements and adding classes via Javascript. The most challenging aspect of the project was probably configuring webpack, but I found it fairly easy to do so by following the tutorials in webpack's documentation. Another "first" in this project was using webfonts, which I had not done before. It look a little while to get them figured out, but once I understood the process I found it to be quite easy. Finally, I used css variables in styling for some shared colors, which was very useful and I will certainly be doing again in future projects.

Overall, this was a fun project to work on. I found the logic of ES6 modules to be straightforward, so I took the opportunity to try a few other tricks I had read about (webfonts, css variables) and I feel like I was able to learn quite a bit. My overall design/styling still needs improvement, but the more I practice the better I get.
